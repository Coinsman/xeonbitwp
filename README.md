# Xeonbit Gateway for WooCommerce

## Features

* Payment validation done through either `xeonbit-wallet-rpc` or the [explorer.xeonbit.com blockchain explorer](https://explorer.xeonbit.com).
* Validates payments with `cron`, so does not require users to stay on the order confirmation page for their order to validate.
* Order status updates are done through AJAX instead of Javascript page reloads.
* Customers can pay with multiple transactions and are notified as soon as transactions hit the mempool.
* Configurable block confirmations, from `0` for zero confirm to `60` for high ticket purchases.
* Live price updates every minute; total amount due is locked in after the order is placed for a configurable amount of time (default 60 minutes) so the price does not change after order has been made.
* Hooks into emails, order confirmation page, customer order history page, and admin order details page.
* View all payments received to your wallet with links to the blockchain explorer and associated orders.
* Optionally display all prices on your store in terms of Xeonbit.
* Shortcodes! Display exchange rates in numerous currencies.

## Requirements

* Xeonbit wallet to receive payments - [GUI](https://github.com/xeonbit-project/xeonbit-gui/releases) - [CLI](https://github.com/xeonbit-project/xeonbit/releases) - [Paper]
* [BCMath](http://php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php) - A PHP extension used for arbitrary precision maths

## Installing the plugin

* Download the plugin from the [releases page](https://github.com/xeonbit-project/xeonbitwp) or clone with `git clone https://github.com/xeonbit-project/xeonbitwp`
* Unzip or place the `xeonbit-woocommerce-gateway` folder in the `wp-content/plugins` directory.
* Activate "Xeonbit Woocommerce Gateway" in your WordPress admin dashboard.
* It is highly recommended that you use native cronjobs instead of WordPress's "Poor Man's Cron" by adding `define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);` into your `wp-config.php` file and adding `* * * * * wget -q -O - https://yourstore.com/wp-cron.php?doing_wp_cron >/dev/null 2>&1` to your crontab.

## Option 1: Use your wallet address and viewkey

This is the easiest way to start accepting Xeonbit on your website. You'll need:

* Your Xeonbit wallet address starting with `4`
* Your wallet's secret viewkey

Then simply select the `viewkey` option in the settings page and paste your address and viewkey. You're all set!

Note on privacy: when you validate transactions with your private viewkey, your viewkey is sent to (but not stored on) xmrchain.net over HTTPS. This could potentially allow an attacker to see your incoming, but not outgoing, transactions if they were to get his hands on your viewkey. Even if this were to happen, your funds would still be safe and it would be impossible for somebody to steal your money. For maximum privacy use your own `xeonbit-wallet-rpc` instance.

## Option 2: Using `xeonbit-wallet-rpc`

The most secure way to accept Xeonbit on your website. You'll need:

* Root access to your webserver
* Latest [Xeonbit-currency binaries](https://github.com/xeonbit-project/xeonbit/releases)

After downloading (or compiling) the Xeonbit binaries on your server, install the [systemd unit files](https://github.com/xeonbit-project/xeonbitwp/tree/master/assets/systemd-unit-files) or run `xeonbitd` and `xeonbit-wallet-rpc` with `screen` or `tmux`. You can skip running `xeonbitd` by using a remote node with `xeonbit-wallet-rpc` by adding `--daemon-address node.xeonbitworld.com:18889` to the `xeonbit-wallet-rpc.service` file.

Note on security: using this option, while the most secure, requires you to run the Xeonbit wallet RPC program on your server. Best practice for this is to use a view-only wallet since otherwise your server would be running a hot-wallet and a security breach could allow hackers to empty your funds.
